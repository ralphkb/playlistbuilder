# Playlist Builder React Application

## Introduction
Playlist Builder is a React Web Application that allows users to customize and add playlists to their Spotify account. Using the Spotify API, this application enables users to authenticate their account then search for songs, albums and artists. The results of the search will be displayed with a preview image, the artist name, song name, album name and track length. The user can easily add or remove any tracks by using the given buttons on the right of each track. Once the user is done creating their new playlist or modifying an existing one, they can give it a custom name, make it private or public and save it to their Spotify account.
