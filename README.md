# Playlist Builder React Application

## Introduction
Playlist Builder is a React Web Application that allows users to customize and add playlists to their Spotify account. Using the Spotify API, this application enables users to authenticate their account then search for songs, albums and artists. The results of the search will be displayed with a preview image, the artist name, song name and album name. The user can easily add or remove any tracks by using the given buttons on the right of each track. Once the user is done creating their new playlist, they can give it a custom name and save it to their Spotify account.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
